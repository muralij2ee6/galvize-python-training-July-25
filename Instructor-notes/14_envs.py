#Virtual Environments 

# something custom to bring into our code, our environment
# but we want to make sure it says in our environment


# The problem - 
# without virtual environments, we can have conflicts between different projects
# all packages get installed in the global python environment


# solution 
# we create isolated environments for each project
# it has its own python interpreter and packages
# prevent dependency conflicts
