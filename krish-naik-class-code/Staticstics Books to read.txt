My two cents is that you need to build the foundations, first.

So to begin, I'd probably start with reading:

Larry Gonick, The Cartoon Guide to Statistics

David Spiegelhalter, The Art of Statistics

Timothy C. Urdan, Statistics in Plain English

OpenIntro Statistics

That'll give you some basics about what statistics can be. Then you need to develop your mathematics skills. For that I'd say to read:

Ian Stewart, Concepts of Modern Mathematics

Trevor Johnson & Hugh Neil, Mathematics: A Complete Introduction

Silvanus Thompson & Martin Gardner, Calculus Made Easy

Daniel Velleman, How to Prove It

P.D. Magnus et al., for all x

Tarski, Introduction to Logic and the Methodology of Deductive Sciences

Gilbert Strang, Linear Algebra and Its Applications

Steven Miller, The Probability Lifesaver Will Kurt, Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way

Raffi Grinberg, The Real Analysis Lifesaver

Then you can get more into statistics:

Savage, The Foundations of Statistics

George Box, Statistics for Experimenters

Wackerly, Mendenhall, & Sheaffer, Mathematical Statistics with Applications

Larry Wasserman, All of Statistics

Larry Wasserman, All of Nonparametric Statistics

George Castella & Roger Berger, Statistical Inference

Kobayashi, Mark, & Turin, Probability, Random Processes, and Statistical Analysis

Kenneth Burnham & David R Anderson, Model Selection and Multimodel Inference

TR Jaynes, Probability Theory: The Logic of Science

Ultimately, statistics is a large enterprise, no one book contains it all, and all the books I listed above doesn't encompass it either. But if you put your mind to it, build a strong foundation, you can keep learning and building and applying.
